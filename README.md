# Javascript Quiz

This application is a one minute code quiz with multiple-choice questions. Users are able to save their scores to a highscore list if the quiz is completed within the time limit. If the timer runs out, the user is not prompted to save their score, and instead asked to restart the quiz at no penalty. The design is simple, but interactive - correct and incorrect answers change colors when clicked, and all buttons change color on hover.
